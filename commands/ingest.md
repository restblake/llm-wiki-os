# /wiki-ingest

Ingest a data source into the wiki. This is the primary way the wiki grows — each ingest reads a source, extracts knowledge, and **disperses it across many pages** (creating new ones and enriching existing ones).

A single source typically touches 10–15 wiki pages.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` — one of:
- **ETL dataset name** (e.g., `gilts`, `inflation`, `bank-rate`) → reads `apps/web/public/data/<name>.json`
- **File path** to a raw source document (article, report, PDF)
- **URL** to an article or data source → fetch with WebFetch

If no argument:
1. Read `wiki/backlog.md` — check for entries in "Built" (ETL done, awaiting ingest) or "Approved" (ready to build)
2. Read `wiki/index.md` — check "Datasets not yet wiki'd"
3. Recommend the highest-value next ingest based on: what has stubs waiting, what connects to the most existing pages, what's in the backlog pipeline

## Process

### Step 1: Check the backlog

Read `wiki/backlog.md`. Is this source in the pipeline?
- If it's in "Approved" or "Built" → great, this ingest was expected. Note the stub pages that were pre-created and the gap it was motivated to fill.
- If it's not in the backlog → that's fine (manual ingest). Add it to "Ingested" at the end.

If stubs exist for this source (pages with `status: stub`), plan to **fill them** rather than creating new pages from scratch.

### Step 2: Read the source

**If ETL dataset:**
1. Read `apps/web/public/data/<name>.json` — understand data shape, coverage, key observations
2. Read the corresponding ETL Go file (`apps/etl/<name>.go`) for source metadata and context
3. Note: source URL, licence, attribution, observation count, date range, annotations

**If file or URL:**
1. Read/fetch the content
2. Extract: key facts, claims, named entities, events, data points, dates
3. Assess: source credibility, potential biases, date of publication

### Step 2: Read the existing wiki state

1. Read `wiki/index.md` — what pages already exist?
2. Read `wiki/CLAUDE.md` — refresh on page type conventions, data quality conventions, and cross-reference rules
3. Read every existing page that this source intersects with (entities, events, concepts already mentioned)
4. Identify: which existing pages need updating, what new pages need creating, and **where the new source contradicts existing wiki content**

### Step 3: Pre-compile cross-temporal facts

This is critical. The wiki should be **pre-compiled, not re-derived on every query.**

For this new source, look at every existing event, era, and synthesis page and ask:
- **What was this new dataset doing during that event/era?**
- Extract the specific data points (dates, values) and prepare to write them into those pages.

Example: if ingesting inflation data, check every event page:
- "What was CPI during the Brown gold sale (1999-2002)?" → write "CPI was 1.5%" into `events/brown-bottom.md`
- "What was CPI during Black Wednesday (1992-09)?" → write "CPI was X%" into `events/black-wednesday.md`
- "What was CPI during the Truss mini-budget?" → write it into `eras/truss-2022.md`

This way, the next time someone asks "what was inflation during event X?", the answer is already in the wiki — no need to re-derive from raw JSON.

### Step 4: Discuss with the user

Before writing anything, present:

```
## Ingest Plan: <source name>

### Source summary
<2-3 sentences: what this is, coverage, why it matters>

### Key facts/observations
- <fact 1>
- <fact 2>

### Cross-temporal facts to pre-compile
- <event/era page> ← <what this dataset shows during that period>
- ...

### Pages to create (N)
- <page type>/<slug> — <one-line description>

### Pages to update (N)
- <page path> — <what's being added/changed>

### Contradictions detected (N)
- <existing claim> vs <new data> — in <page path>

### Data quality issues to document
- Splice points: <any>
- Coverage gaps: <dataset ends at X, misses Y>
- Overlap with existing datasets: <which, how they compare>

### Total pages touched: N
```

Ask: **"Does this look right? Anything to emphasise or skip?"**

### Step 5: Create and update pages

After user approval:

**New pages must follow `wiki/CLAUDE.md` conventions:**
- Valid YAML frontmatter with `type`, `created`, `updated`, and type-specific fields
- Minimum 3+ outbound `[[wikilinks]]`
- Dataset pages: key observations, limitations, data quality issues, connections
- Entity pages: reference every dataset where the entity appears
- Event pages: cite specific data points from relevant datasets, include government context
- Concept pages: how the concept manifests across datasets

**Updating existing pages:**
- Add new sections, paragraphs, or cross-references — **don't rewrite existing content unless it's factually wrong**
- Write cross-temporal facts as natural prose, not just link lists
- Update frontmatter `updated` date and `datasets` array

**Cross-reference rules (no bare links):**
Every `[[wikilink]]` must have a why-clause — a phrase explaining why the connection matters. Never write bare `- [[page]]`. Always write `- [[page]] — <why this connection is relevant>`.

Example:
- WRONG: `- [[datasets/gilts]]`
- RIGHT: `- [[datasets/gilts]] — gilt yields spiked to 4.5% during the mini-budget, the sharpest modern move`

**Contradiction handling:**
When new data contradicts existing wiki content, do NOT silently overwrite. Add a `### Disputed` subsection showing both claims with citations.

**Data quality conventions:**
Apply the three mandatory checks from `wiki/CLAUDE.md`:
1. Splice discontinuities → document in `### Disputed`
2. Coverage gaps → note what's missing
3. Overlap divergence → compare in the overlap period

### Step 6: Create synthesis pages

**Be aggressive.** If the ingested source connects to 2+ existing datasets in a non-obvious way, create a `synthesis/` page. Synthesis pages are the wiki's highest-value output.

### Step 7: Update overview

If `wiki/overview.md` exists, update it with any significant new knowledge from this ingest. The overview is the living narrative of what the wiki knows.

### Step 8: Update index and log

1. Update `wiki/index.md` — add new pages (alphabetical within sections), update descriptions
2. Append to `wiki/log.md` using the full format (list every page path touched, what was added to each)

### Step 9: Propose schema improvements

After the ingest, consider: does `wiki/CLAUDE.md` need to evolve? New page type, new convention, new frontmatter field? If so, propose it.

### Step 10: Update the backlog

Read `wiki/backlog.md` and update:
- If this source was in "Approved" or "Built" → move it to "Ingested" with today's date
- If this source was NOT in the backlog (manual ingest) → add it to "Ingested"
- Remove `status: stub` from any stub pages that were filled during this ingest
- Note: the backlog is the compounding loop's memory — keep it accurate

### Step 11: Suggest what to do next

Read the backlog and the wiki state to recommend the highest-value next action:

```
### Suggested next
- **Questions to ask**: <2-3 questions that this new data makes answerable>
- **Sources to investigate**: <any gaps this ingest revealed>
- **Datasets to ingest next**: <highest-value item from backlog, or un-ingested dataset>
- **Backlog status**: N discovered, M approved, K built (awaiting ingest), J ingested
```

The wiki should be **generative** — every operation suggests the next one.

### Step 12: Commit

```bash
cd wiki && git add -A && git commit -m "ingest: <source> — N created, M updated"
```
